# Autopilot log

## 2026-10-03 — D3 Dashboard → Development v2.26
- Pending sales verification = ? → sale_status "deposited" (existing `pendingVerification` in sale.list.hook; verify only from Deposited, memory)
- Pending vouchers = ? → status "pending" (existing status; dashboard is manager-only, so actionable)
- Attention items → overdue receivables, overdue payables, payables due this week, vouchers awaiting approval, sales awaiting verification (roadmap list; near-due receivables/checks left to admin)
- Aggregate attention tap → module with status preset via useFilterField (no single record for an aggregate; ?focus needs one id)
- Monthly expenses source → expense-type sumCountedRows MTD (same definition as Today's Expenses; no new rule)
- Phone vs desktop order → two compositions behind DashboardBoard(useIsCompact) (DOM order differs; CSS order would fight bento)
- Desktop → main: Today → Needs attention (full) → AR/AP/Monthly Sales/Monthly Expenses → trends; aside keeps Notifications feed (attention stays second at every width)
- Phone notifications feed → dropped from body (app-bar alerts sheet already carries it)
- KPI tap → StatCard `href` mirroring MetricTile Link (no new primitive; PriorityMetric/DashboardMetricGroup not needed)
- AttentionList home → moved admin/home → dashboard/ (shared by main + admin); item.meta replaces hard-coded "accounts"
- Admin Home dominance → AttentionList moved above period switch + tiles
- Verification: yarn build + yarn lint clean; compiled, visuals unconfirmed

## 2026-10-03 — leftovers → Development v2.27
- Uncommitted autopilot conductor/worker rewrite + CLAUDE.md → committed as its own version (Worker step 3); build + lint clean

## 2026-10-03 — D4 Record cards + detail sheets → Development v2.28
- Card layout → keep generic DataTableCards, cap meta at 2 (audit's dedicated transaction summary not needed; role mapping already right)
- Overflow meta → shown in the detail sheet's core meta list; sheet opens whenever there is overflow, sections or actions (no data lost on phone)
- Cap when onRowClick is set → no cap (card opens a different record, so no sheet holds the overflow)
- Whole-card press → existing title overlay press; separate "Show details" button replaced by a decorative chevron (one tap target)
- Sheet footer actions → DataTable `detailActions` + IRowAction `priority` (reuses the row-action shape; destructive keeps useConfirm)
- Confirm from sheet → keep the sheet open under the confirmation (cancel returns to the record; delete closes it as the row leaves)
- Sheet types → SheetKind action/detail/form/flow via one drawerKind cva; AppModal `fill` → kind "form"; default action = no visual change for existing sheets
- Transactions balance impact / debit-credit → not added (would invent an accounting rule); sections regrouped Details → Financial details → Audit
- Detail rows → wrap long values instead of truncating (description was cut off in sheets)
- Primary CTA height → 48px through sheetActions selector (beats drawerFooter's 44px), other footers unchanged until D9
- Verification: yarn build + yarn lint clean; compiled, visuals unconfirmed
