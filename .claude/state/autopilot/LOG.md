# Autopilot log

## 2026-10-03 — D3 Dashboard → Development v2.26
- Pending sales verification = ? → sale_status "deposited" (existing `pendingVerification` in sale.list.hook; verify only from Deposited, memory)
- Pending vouchers = ? → status "pending" (existing status; dashboard is manager-only, so actionable)
- Attention items → overdue receivables, overdue payables, payables due this week, vouchers awaiting approval, sales awaiting verification (roadmap list; near-due receivables/checks left to admin)
- Aggregate attention tap → module with status preset via useFilterField (no single record for an aggregate; ?focus needs one id)
- Monthly expenses source → expense-type sumCountedRows MTD (same definition as Today's Expenses; no new rule)
- Phone vs desktop order → two compositions behind DashboardBoard(useIsCompact) (DOM order differs; CSS order would fight bento)
- Desktop → main: Today → Needs attention (full) → AR/AP/Monthly Sales/Monthly Expenses → trends; aside keeps Notifications feed (attention stays second at every width)
- Phone notifications feed → dropped from body (app-bar alerts sheet already carries it)
- KPI tap → StatCard `href` mirroring MetricTile Link (no new primitive; PriorityMetric/DashboardMetricGroup not needed)
- AttentionList home → moved admin/home → dashboard/ (shared by main + admin); item.meta replaces hard-coded "accounts"
- Admin Home dominance → AttentionList moved above period switch + tiles
- Verification: yarn build + yarn lint clean; compiled, visuals unconfirmed
